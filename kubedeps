    Usage:
    kubedeps [child_process_cmd]

    child_process_cmd:  any executable command with its argments, as a single string
                        e.g. \"sh -c 'ls -la'\"

    environment variables:
      KUBEDEPS_POLLING_INTERVAL
        e.g. 30
        default to 10
        used to determine the number of seconds between each check (birth and death)
      KUBEDEPS_NAME
        e.g. my_process_name
        required
        the name of the kubedeps process and will be the filename of the tombstone, this is the name that should be refered to in birth and death deps
      KUBEDEPS_GRAVEYARD
        e.g. /graveyard
        required
        the path of the kubedeps graveyard
      KUBEDEPS_BIRTH_DEPS
        e.g. deps1,deps2
        default to none (empty string)
        list of comma separated birth deps (corresponding to KUBEDEPS_NAME of the deps). Note that birth deps will be fulfilled once all the birth deps are in ready state (not just born).
      KUBEDEPS_BIRTH_TIMEOUT
        e.g. 15
        default to 30
        number of seconds before considering that process birth wait timed out
      KUBEDEPS_DEATH_DEPS
        e.g. deps3,deps4
        default to none (empty string)
        list of comma separated death deps (corresponding to KUBEDEPS_NAME of the deps)
      KUBEDEPS_GRACE_PERIOD
        e.g. 45
        default to 30
        grace period for the child process to exit before exiting the kubedeps process, note that we will not force kill the child process but just exit
      KUBEDEPS_READY_CMD
        e.g. ls
        default to none (empty string)
        command exiting with 0 when process is ready or else with a non-zero exit code
      KUBEDEPS_READY_INTERVAL
        e.g. 10
        default to 5
        number of seconds between each KUBEDEPS_READY_CMD invocation
      KUBEDEPS_READY_TIMEOUT
        e.g. 60
        default to 30
        number of seconds before considering that the child process failed to start
      KUBEDEPS_EXIT_CODE
        e.g. 0
        default to none, will use the child process exit code
        exit code used by the kubedeps process
      KUBEDEPS_DISABLE_LOGGING
        if this variable is set, kubedeps will do less verbose logging, e.g. not log the config at startup
